[Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

Found a lot of sharing concerns in Domain Driven Design & UX principles. 

Domain Driven Design also plays nice with Agile methodologies.
Cutting edge ideas like [EventSourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) been already successfully implemented in some frontend tools

##### Main concerns are

* Clean maintainable code
* Separation of Concerns
* Scalable layered app structure
* Ubiqutous Language aka Requirement understanding
